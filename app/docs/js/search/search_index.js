While my background is Java, I have been focusing my attention on JavaScript development since June 2014, working with frameworks such as Angular, React and GraphQL. My passion is developing for the Node.js runtime.        I have a strong sense of responsibility and am always driven to deliver on or ahead of deadlines. Front-end or back-end, I\\'m equally comfortable performing either or both.        Hobbies and Interests         Photography,  Android,  travel and  plane spotting - not necessarily in that order.
